nventory/

Owns: Party inventory and equipment flow:

Stash/bag CRUD

Equip/unequip to characters

Shop transaction rules (price, availability hooks)
Exposes:

Add/remove/list items

Equip/unequip and validation

Purchase/sell operations
Depends on: core (state/events), data (items), character, party.
Must not depend on: ui, combat.
Why: One place governs items and avoids gold drift.
