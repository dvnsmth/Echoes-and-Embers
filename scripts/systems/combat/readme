combat/

Owns: Encounter lifecycle and turn system:

Initiative/ATB, turn start/end

Action resolution (attack, skill, item, flee)

Status effect ticking and cooldowns
Exposes:

Start/stop encounter

Query battlefield state

Apply action (by ID) and return results
Depends on: core (events/state/constants), character, inventory, skills, data (enemies, loot tables).
Must not depend on: ui, town.
Why: Allows a headless combat sim; UI is just a viewer/controller.
