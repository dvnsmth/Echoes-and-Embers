Owns: Character identity and growth:

Creation (species/class/starting stats)

Derived stats & level-up math

Equipment slots and status flags (alive, KOâ€™d, debuffs)
Exposes:

Create/clone character

Compute/refresh derived stats

Depends on: core (state/constants/util), data (species, classes).
Must not depend on: ui, town, combat.
Why: Keeps characters reusable in Party, Combat, and Town screens.
